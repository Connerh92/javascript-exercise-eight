This is a JavaScript exercise refactoring given code and TDD. Jest is used for test running. Being used to working with React, as a refactoring solution, going for an OOP approach made sense.

I have the habbit of always using a "comments.md" file, where I kind of log every step of the process. Some people would call this redundant, but I find it very usefull to retrace anything very quickly.

The requirements are added as well("requirements.txt"). I deleted the coverage folder after using it, no need to keep or even hide it, lighter load.
The original readme explains the required steps to use this repo(npm install) and for testing the code, some extra notes are also added in "comments.md" if needed.

Here under is the original readme:
